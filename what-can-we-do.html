Ratify international and regional treaties </strong>that protect the rights of women and girls, and ensure that national laws and services meet international human rights standards.<br><br><strong>2. Adopt and enforce laws </strong>to end impunity, bring perpetrators of violence against women and girls to justice and provide women with reparations and remedy for the violations perpetrated against them.<br><br><strong>3. Develop national and local action plans </strong>for ending violence against women and girls in every country that bring the government, women’s and other civil society organizations, the mass media and the private sector into a coordinated, collective front against such human rights violations.<br><br><strong>4. Make justice accessible to women and girls </strong>by providing free legal and specialized services, and increasing women in law enforcement and frontline services.<br><br><strong>5. End impunity towards conflict-related sexual violence </strong>by prosecuting perpetrators in conflict and post-conflict contexts and fulfilling survivors’ right to comprehensive reparations programmes that are non-stigmatizing and have a transformative impact on women and girls’ lives.<br><br><strong>6. Ensure universal access to critical services </strong>at a minimum, women’s and girls’ emergency and immediate needs should be met through free 24-hour hotlines, prompt intervention for their safety and protection, safe housing and shelter for them and their children, counseling and psycho-social support, post-rape care, and free legal aid to understand their rights and options.<br><br><strong>7. Train providers of frontline services </strong>especially the police, lawyers and judges, social workers and health personnel to ensure that they follow quality standards and protocols. Services should be confidential, sensitive and convenient to women survivors.<br><br><strong>8. Provide adequate public resources&nbsp;</strong>to implement existing laws and policies, recognizing the devastating costs and consequences of violence against women not only for the lives directly affected, but to society and the economy at large, and to public budgets.<br><br><strong>9. Collect, analyze and disseminate national data&nbsp;</strong>on prevalence, causes and consequences of violence against women and girls, profiles of survivors and perpetrators, and progress and gaps in the implementation of national policies, plans and laws.<br><br><strong>10. Invest in gender equality and women’s empowerment </strong>to tackle the root causes of violence against women and girls. Strategic areas are girls’ secondary education, advancing women’s reproductive health and rights, addressing the inter-linkages of violence with HIV and AIDS, and increasing women’s political and economic participation and leadership. Gender equality and ending violence against women must be placed squarely at the heart of achieving the Millennium Development Goals.<br><br><strong>11. Enhance women’s economic empowerment </strong>by ensuring women’s rights to own land and property, to inheritance, equal pay for equal work, and safe and decent employment. Women’s unequal economic and employment opportunities are a major factor in perpetuating their entrapment in situations of violence, exploitation and abuse.<br><br><strong>12. Increase public awareness and social mobilization </strong>to stop violence against women and girls, and to enable women and girls subjected to violence to break the silence and seek justice and support.<br><br><strong>13. Engage the mass media </strong>in shaping public opinion and challenging the harmful gender norms that perpetuate violence against women and girls.<br><br><strong>14. Work for and with young people as champions of change </strong>to end violence against women, and ensure that educational systems empower girls and boys to transform and build gender relations based on harmony, mutual respect and non-violence.<br><br><strong>15. Mobilize men and boys </strong>of all ages and walks of life to take a stand against violence against women and girls, and foster equality and gender solidarity.<br><br><strong>16. Donate to the UN Trust Fund to End Violence against Women </strong>the only grant-making fund in the world exclusively dedicated to channeling expertise and financial support to national, local and grassroots efforts.<br><br><strong>Learn more at </strong><a href="https://www.unwomen.org/en/news/in-focus/end-violence-against-women/2011/16-steps-policy-agenda">UNWOMEN</a><br>(United Nations Commision on the Status of Women, 2011)<br><br></p>

            <p style="font-family: Alegreya, serif;color: rgb(255,255,255);text-align: justify;margin: 0%;margin-top: 10px;margin-bottom: 020px;font-size: 20px;width: 100%;"><strong>1. Identify and report</strong>&nbsp;any physical or verbal aggression towards women that you witness, regardless of the environment in which you find yourself. Justifying inappropriate attitudes and believing that at parties, bars or discos "anything goes" aggravates the problem.<br><br><strong>2. If you suspect</strong> that a woman you know is a victim of gender violence, <strong>talk to her and offer your help.</strong><br><br><strong>3. If you perceive that your friend, partner or brother is abusive or aggressive</strong> towards women, <strong>invite him</strong> to seek professional attention.<br><br><strong>4. Stop for a second and look inward.</strong> Many cases of sexual violence against women are known, but very few men recognize themselves as aggressors. This is what is called the "phantom aggressor" and occurs, above all, when identifying in oneself the most normalized types of violence (inappropriate compliments, sexual comments out of place, insistence when flirting, etc.).<br><br><strong>5. The fight against male violence is a social problem that has its origin in gender inequalities.</strong> You also play a fundamental role in sensitizing other men to the importance of banishing inequality in order to become promoters of equality.<br><br><strong>6. Sorority...</strong> also male! If you refuse to consume magazines that objectify women, if you do not go to places where women do not pay admission, or if you explain to your friends that if they believe in gender equality (whether they know it or not) they are feminists, you will be in solidarity with women in the struggle for their rights.<br><br><strong>7. Also disassociate yourself from sexist jokes and comments</strong> that, far from being harmless, perpetuate the sexism present in the collective imagination and make women visible as weak people subjected to the strength of men.<br><br>(Sanz, A., 2019)</p>
