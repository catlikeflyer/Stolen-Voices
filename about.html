Its main goal is to make the user reflect on all the gender-related violence happening in the country and to create awareness that in such situations, the decision the victim makes if no influential factor to justify the actions of the perpetrators. At the end of the story, you'll be presented a real situation that happened to someone or a factual data about the situation, just because she made the same decisions you've made in the game. It is impossible for us to fully understand the pain and frustrations them and their families have gone through, but we think it is possible to grow empathy and solidarity of what's been happening in our society. To raise our voices, to help out fight unfairness and injustice starting now, at last you'll be presented on what you can do to prevent and eradicate violence and unfairness.&nbsp;</p>

People in Mexico, specially women, have been living their daily lives in fear of something happening to them. Unfortunately, we live in a world in constant worry for our sisters, mothers, and friends even with daily activities such as transportation, work, parties, reunions and much more. With the help of this game, we try to acknowledge that all those daily decisions a woman makes, may lead to a frustrating outcome, and the blame should NEVER be placed over the victim than the aggressor(s).</p>

            <h1 style="font-family: 'Londrina Solid', cursive;text-align: left;color: rgb(255,255,255);width: 100%;">Why do we present real life cases?</h1>

Unfortunately, Mexico is one of the countries with the most femicides occurring. According to the Citizens National Observatory of Femicides from January 1st 2020 to November 25th 2020, there have been an estimated 2,874 femicides in the country, and just 724 were being investigated as so. With the recurrence of these events, it is of priority to humanize each and every one of the victims, to remember their memories, dreams, and HUMANITY to prevent and avoid the normalization of femicides.</p>
